# HUP Pathology R Workshop

## Welcome!

This introductory R workshop aims to teach participants with little or no programming experience the basics of the R statistical programming language for reproducible laboratory data analytics. R is a freely available programming environment that is aimed squarely at common activities in data analysis including complex data manipulation, statistical analysis, automation, and publication-quality data visualization. We will introduce basic concepts of R programming as well as more generalizable best practices in working with laboratory data.

For the best experience, please have the following ready before the workshop begins:

-   *Preferably* two monitors (or two laptops), one for the Zoom conference software, and one in which you will work. Otherwise you'll have a bunch of switching back and forth.

-   Install the latest version of [Zoom](https://zoom.us/download).

-   Install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) as some [older browsers](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/227449447-Supported-browsers-for-RStudio-Connect) may not be compatible with the RStudio application).

-   We will be using RStudio Cloud as our training environment.
    -   Please sign up for a free account [here](https://rstudio.cloud/).
        -   After logging in you should see a screen like this:

            ![](www/default.png)

    -   Then use [this](https://rstudio.cloud/project/3364717 "Rstudio Cloud") link to access our Workshop Project
        -   You should see a spinny icon like this:

            <img src="www/deploying.png" width="273"/>

    -   Then you'll then see a full RStudio Screen like this:

        ![](www/rstudio.PNG)

    -   Finally, on the upper right, you'll see text that says "TEMPORARY COPY. Save a Permanent Copy" Press the text that says "Save a Permanent Copy".

    -   You're Done!

-   Calendar invites with Zoom details were sent out last week.

-   Please complete the following survey so we can better understand your R experience and what you want out of the course: [API R Workshop Participant Survey](https://forms.gle/Xe3U71ZBZRmrP2E87).

The workshop is scheduled to begin on 12/20 at 3 pm ET. It will run at the same time from 12/20-12/23.

Please make every effort to log into the Zoom conference 5 - 10 minutes early to allow time to get settled, ensure your computer audio and video is set up, and get RStudio cloud up and running.

## Accessing/interacting with the course content

1.  Course content will be pre-loaded in the RStudio instance and is available for download there as a .zip file.
2.  The content is available at [our course github page](https://github.com/amromeo/hup_path_r_workshop) and can be downloaded from there as well.

## A note on the mechanics and etiquette of the virtual workshop

-   Please refrain from screen grabbing other user's information, recording the workshop, or otherwise disrupting the flow of the Zoom Meeting.
-   Please exercise appropriate Zoom etiquette by muting your microphone during sessions. Breakout sessions will be used for those who request additional one-one-one assistance during exercises.

## IMPORTANT: Installing RStudio onto your own computer

We will be utilizing our cloud based RStudio instance in the workshop. However, *in the long term*, you will need R and RStudio installed **on your own computer** in order to work on private data. You can find step by step instructions for installing these on macOS ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g)) or Windows ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)).
